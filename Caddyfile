# Caddyfile to build a man in the middle reverse proxy helping to realize Connections Customizer Extemsions
#
# Get caddy from: https://caddyserver.com/
#
# Here's the trick
#
# 1- You override your hosts file by adding 
#		127.0.0.1 <your connections datacenter hostname>
# 2- You set Caddy to generate a self signed certificate and act as a reverse proxy if front of connections cloud
# 3- Proxy exceptions and rewrite rules in this configuration exclude a subset of the Connections Customizer url space
# 4- A rewrite rule maps local filesystem to the muse-static url space allowing to load resources from local

https://apps.ce.collabserv.com {

	# 2 - Setup self signed certificate
	tls self_signed

	# 3 - Setup proxy rule to reverse-proxy the actual  Connections Cloud environmnet
	#	- Notice the "except" rule excluding paths served by your customization

	proxy / https://104.83.92.234 {
		header_upstream Host {host}
		header_downstream -Strict-Transport-Security ""
		except /files/muse-static/com_appfusions /static
		insecure_skip_verify
	}

    proxy /activerse/ http://localhost:3000/ {

	}

	# 4 - Setup a rewrite rule serving local resources as if they were deployed in Connections Customizer
	rewrite /files/muse-static/com_appfusions/ {
		regexp (.*)
		to /static/com_appfusions/{1}
	} 

	rewrite /files/muse-static/com_appfusions_demos/ {
		regexp (.*)
		to /static/com_appfusions_demos/{1}
	} 

}

# Note on HSTS security and how o workaround it
# 
# Connections Cloud implements HSTS rules
#
# This solution is an actual man in the middle type of attack and you need to circumvent security controls in your development browser
#
# Chrome tip: when the unsecured site screen is shown.. just type "badidea" and a temporary session will be started allowed you
# to work against the "proxied" environment disregarding the HSTS warning
